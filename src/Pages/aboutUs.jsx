        <h5>What is a Hackathon?</h5>
        <p>
          A hackathon is a problem-solving competition in which a diverse group
          of people form a team and decide to collaborate intensively to develop
          solutions to given problems or "challenge sets". A cause hackathon,
          such as this Sustainability hackathon, is an event focussed on
          increasing awareness of global causes and providing avenues for
          participation to become engaged and involved in making the world a
          better place.
