          <p>
            A hackathon is a problem-solving competition in which a diverse
            group of people form a team and decide to collaborate intensively to
            develop solutions to given problems or "challenge sets". A cause
            hackathon, such as this Sustainability hackathon, is an event
            focussed on increasing awareness of global causes and providing
            avenues for participation to become engaged and involved in making
            the world a better place.
